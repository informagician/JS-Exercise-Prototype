  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

        + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
        + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. Global - Considering everything in Javascript is an object, if this is not inside a declared object, it will refer to window object as its global parent.
  2. Implicit - when this is used in a declared object, the value of this refers to the closest parent object.
  3. Explicit - when there are multiple object references or nested objects using this may result in undefined values. to resolve this we use call,apply and bind methods to explicitly tell this refer to what context.
  4. New - when new keyword is used, a new object is created. when a new keyword is used: the keyword this in the function will refer to the object created, an implicit return is added to the object it has created.
